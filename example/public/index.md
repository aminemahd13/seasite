<img src="../img/dirk_400x400.jpg" height="64" class="about-pic"> My name is Dirk Holtwick.
 
I'm an independent software developer based in MÃ¼lheim an der Ruhr, Germany.

Since 1999 I have been working with companies like [Evernote](https://evernote.com), [Cellular](https://www.cellular.de) and [eGenix](https://www.egenix.com). 

I also created commercial and open source software myself like [Receipts](https://www.receipts-app.com) and [xhtml2pdf](https://github.com/xhtml2pdf/xhtml2pdf).

My goal is to solve complex problems elegantly and therefore I have been developing with all popular technologies and operation systems. Though my favorite targets are **macOS and iOS** and **modern web technologies**.

If you like to learn more about my current project follow me on [Twitter](https://github.com/holtwick) or read my [blog](blog/).
