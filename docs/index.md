# Documentation of "SeaSite"

> Author: Dirk Holtwick, [holtwick.de](https://holtwick.de)

## Introduction

The purpose of SeaSite is to provide an **easy** and **cross platform consistent** way to **create websites**. This is achieved by using common HTML and Javascript techniques, that are similar to those used for dynamic web pages.

It all started with my own websites and an article I wrote in my blog about the technique I used: <https://holtwick.de/blog/static-jquery>

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to install SeaSite globally:

```sh
npm install seasite -g
```

This will install a command line tool called `seasite` that you can now use to setup a project in an empty folder:

```sh
seasite init
npm install
```

The following command will create the site in the folder `dist`:

```sh
npm start
```
